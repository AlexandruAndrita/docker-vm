### docker-vm

The scope of this repository is to access a docker image deployed in a Azure VM. The original, now adapted, docker image was taken from [Mirai: Mammography-based model for breast cancer risk](https://github.com/yala/Mirai).

The algorithm, initially working only with mammographies produced by `HOLOGIC Inc.`, was adapted to work with images from other manufactures like `GE MEDICAL SYSTEMS` and `GE HEALTHCARE`.
